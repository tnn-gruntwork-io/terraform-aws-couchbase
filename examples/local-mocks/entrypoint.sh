# We need systemd to run to fire up Couchbase itself. To run systemd, we have to run /sbin/init at the end of this
# script. So how can we run the code we need on boot that normally lives in User Data? Well, our solution is to run
# it using systemd as well! We create a SystemD unit here that will execute our User Data script on boot. The User
# Data script is specified as an environment variable in docker-compose.yml. We also forward any environment variables
# set in docker-compose.yml of the form USER_DATA_ENV_xxx to the User Data script.
